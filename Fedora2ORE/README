The Fedora to OAI-ORE tool "Fedora2ORE" enables the generation of OAI-ORE Resource-Maps 
from a Fedora repository. Based on the  Fedora Digital Object Model, Fedora2ORE can 
explore properties and relationships about a digital object and map them to the OAI-ORE data Model.
Fedora2ORE is available in two different distributions, a Java distribution and RESTFul Webservice 
that simply encloses the Java-distribution and provides its functionality in a RESTFul manner.
